# Spotfolio

Spotfolio is an ongoing full-stack Flask application designed to harness the power of the Spotify API, allowing users to showcase their song, album, and artist preferences on a personalized webpage. Whether you're a music enthusiast, a curator, or an artist looking to share your tastes with the world, Spotfolio offers a seamless platform to do just that.

This still an early project, so there may be issues that still need to be ironed out. However I think its a good start!
